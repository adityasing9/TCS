# Python Multi-Client Chat Server

A simple multi-client chat server built using Python sockets and threading.

This project demonstrates how to build a basic TCP server that allows multiple clients to connect and communicate in real time.

---

## Overview

This chat server:

- Uses TCP socket programming
- Supports multiple clients simultaneously
- Handles each client in a separate thread
- Broadcasts messages to all connected users
- Allows server-side message input
- Supports graceful shutdown using the `exit` command

---

## How It Works

1. The server starts on port 5000.
2. Clients connect using TCP.
3. Each client runs in a separate thread.
4. When a client sends a message, it is broadcast to all other connected clients.
5. The server admin can also send messages from the terminal.
6. Typing `exit` stops the server safely.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone <your-repo-link>

2. Navigate into the project folder:

   cd <project-folder>

3. Run the server:

   python mchat.py

4. Connect Using Netcat from another terminal:

   Linux:
   nc (server-ip) 5000

   Windows:
   telnet (server-ip) 5000

## Default Configuration

- Host: All available network interfaces
- Port: 5000

You can change the port inside `mchat.py` if needed.

## Features

- Real-time messaging
- Multi-client support
- Thread-based handling
- Server broadcast capability
- Automatic client disconnection handling

---

## Limitations

- No authentication
- No encryption (not secure for public internet use)
- No message history storage
- Command-line only (no GUI)

---

## Possible Improvements

- Add user authentication
- Add private messaging
- Add SSL encryption
- Add logging system
- Build GUI client
- Deploy to cloud server
